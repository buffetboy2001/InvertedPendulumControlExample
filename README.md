InvertedPendulumControlExample
==============================

Hey. 

If you're here, then you're either bored or you know that the inverted pendulum problem is a standard problem in controls engineering. I have built a simulation of this problem. I did not re-derive the state-space formulation myself; I used http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=InvertedPendulum&section=SystemModeling. For the ODE propogation, I used OpenSourcePhysics (www.OpenSourcePhysics.org). The PID implementation is my own and available in the Control-Component-Library (https://github.com/buffetboy2001/Control-Component-Library). 

Cheers. Stuart Bowman
